<p>Hello, I'm John - a passionate individual with a love for science and
technology. My early career path led me towards medicine and emergency medical
services as an EMT, Paramedic, and Firefighter Paramedic. While these were
fulfilling experiences, my passion for technology and coding took root and
eventually led me to pursue a career as a software engineer. As a self-taught
developer, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various
libraries and frameworks. Currently, I am focused on front-end development and
am teaching myself React.js to further advance my skills. I'm driven to become a
full-stack developer and bring my expertise to a dynamic team that values
innovation and creativity. My diverse background in medicine and technology has
given me a unique perspective that allows me to approach coding challenges with
a critical and analytical mindset.</p>
