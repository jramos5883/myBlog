      Hello, I'm John - a passionate individual with a love for science and
      technology. My early career path led me towards medicine and emergency
      medical services as an EMT, Paramedic, and Firefighter Paramedic. While
      these were fulfilling experiences, my passion for technology and coding
      took root and eventually led me to pursue a career as a software engineer.
      As a self-taught developer, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS,
      JavaScript, and various libraries and frameworks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I am focused on front-end development and am teaching myself
      React.js to further advance my skills. I'm driven to become a full-stack
      developer and bring my expertise to a dynamic team that values innovation
      and creativity. My diverse background in medicine and technology has given
      me a unique perspective that allows me to approach coding challenges with
      a critical and analytical mindset.
