      <h2>Preperation and Research</h2>
      <p>2/18/2023</p>
      <p>
        I've spent the past weeks preparing to apply for tech positions. I've
        created my Linked'in account, rewritten my resume, created a portfolio
        webpage, and got some real world coding experience by building a website
        for a resturant. Honestly, from looking back at where I started my
        coding journey to where I am now, I am happy with all that I have
        learned and accomplished thus far. It feels as if I am moving into a new
        phase of my coding journey. From my studies and experiences over the
        past few months, I feel ready to put myself out there and show the tech
        world what I'm made of. And now that I've completed my initial
        preperations to start applying, it is time to do...
      </p>
      <p>
        ...more research! Woo hoo! Trust me, I am excited about it! As a self
        taught developer, research has been a huge part of my process. Over the
        past few months, I've come to realize that becoming a good programmer
        means becoming a good problem solver. Especially being a self taught
        developer, learning to utilize sites like stack overflow and google to
        efficently find solutions for bugs or other problems is a skill in
        itself. As I continue on my coding journey, I am happy with the
        foundation of knowledge that I have accquired up until this point. While
        I apply for coding positions, I plan on building more personal projects,
        practicing more leet code questions, and learning more relavant
        technologies. From my research, I have decided that the next technology
        worth learning for myself and my future career would be React. My last
        note, as I research the best ways to teach myself React, is that I've
        come to learn to enjoy the process of coding. There is a cycle of
        preperation and research that is needed to learn efficiently and stay
        motivated. As I continue to imporve on my coding abilities, I also want
        to continue to improve on my so called "process".

      <h2>Show Your Work!</h2>
      <p>2/15/2023</p>
      <p>
        After reading the book, "Show Your Work! written by Austin Kleon, I've
        decided to create a website/blog where I can share some of the
        experiences and knowledge that I've acquired during my slef taught
        coding journey. I want to use this blog as a way to share with the world
        what I'm learning, what I'm working on, and what I want to accomplish in
        the future.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now that I've spent the past few months teaching myself the basics of
        coding and web development, I am eager to make my break into the tech
        industry. My short term goals are to continue learning everything that I
        can about coding and land my first job as a junior software engineer.
        Some long term goals that I have are building a brand for myself,
        building a email newsletter, and building a community.
      </p>
